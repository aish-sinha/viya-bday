Happy Birthday, my sweet daughter 😘🥳🥳🥳
Even though you're far away in Singapore, you're always right here in my heart❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️. All I want today is for you to feel the love I have for you, even from miles away, and know how much I long to be with you.
There isn't a moment in computer class that doesn't remind me of you. Our endless conversations, our laughter that filled the room, and the way everything felt lighter when you were around. You made those classes something I looked forward to every day.
Amit Sir still talks about now and then.. he asks like how is ur friend now what is she doing and all…it make me cry sometimes😭 but I really miss your spark, your unforgettable presence. And omg computer festttt. I miss those days sooooo much🫶🫶. I remember you singing the moana song. During our recent computer fest, I missed you more than ever. I felt soo bored without you. I mean you were always my partner — my go-to, my comfort, my teammate in every sense.
I still remember our fist meeting like it was just last month.. our bus ride where I spoke the most but that’s when it started.. I was sooo happy I met you that day… omg hackers hideout remember that’s what we went to bits for and you used ur wonderful ChatGPT skills and got us 2nd place.
Ughhh I miss you soooo muchhh. I’m sooooo proud of everything you’re doing over there🥰🥰, but there's still a part of me that wishes you were right here, laughing beside me like old times.
I love you sooooo sooooo much that nothing can describe it, and I miss you even more… I hope today brings you all the love and happiness you deserve. Happy birthday once again. 😘😘😘😘🥳🥳🥳..may your life be filled with joy.. 🙃🙃🙃🙃

With all the love in the world,
Your Mother`,

Babe you are literally one of the kindest souls I’ve ever met. Your smile, your kindness, your voice is so damn mesmerizing it’s insane. We’ve missed you so so much and it’s crazy to imagine that you’re so far away, but no matter how far you are I hope you know how grateful we are for you and how much we love you. I hope this puts a smile on that gorgeous face of yours. I remember it was only in around may last year that I met you and look how far we’ve come 🥹. I hope you achieve everything you’ve ever dreamed of with us being a small part of that heaven you create. I hope you realize that you are loved and that no matter how far you are we will always be here for you. Thank you for blessing our lives with your presence and I am jealous of those you’ll meet in the future for you are literally an angel on earth. My prettiest Viya I wish you the happiest birthday, make this an amazing day, have lots of fun, and that would be the best gift for us all. 
Lots and lots of love and kisses

i don’t even know where to begin because there’s so much i want to say and so much i feel. today is your day, but honestly, the world feels like it shines a little brighter every single day just because you’re in it.

i still remember how we met lollll. through whatsapp of all things. you were looking for computer notes, and Annabel passed you my name, and somehow that tiny moment turned into something so beautiful. from the first texts, something about you felt loving and warm and kind, like the universe was slowly tying a red thread between us. then, in computer class, when i found out you liked kpop too (when shreesha and i were talking abt it), i swear my whole heart lit up.

and then came that bits competition. just you and me, paired, putting our little brains together LMAOOO and using your amazing chatgpt magic to win second place. i remember laughing with you and just feeling this quiet joy because working with you didn’t feel like a task, it felt like flow, like friendship, like fun. it felt easy and whole.

after that, everything just kept weaving together. your voice, your heart, your way of making me feel seen. i don’t think you even realize the kind of light you bring. you’re not just someone who sings beautifully, and omgomgomgomg, you rlly do, you’re someone whose voice feels like comfort. you sing the way hugs feel. the way healing feels. LITERALLY.

you have this rare gift, yk? you just know how to make someone feel better. you don’t force it, you don’t rush it, you’re just there in this gentle, steady way. with you, there’s no pretending. i can just be me. whatever version of me shows up, you always make space for her.

you taught me how to say i love you. not just with words but with little things: soft check-ins, shared songs, the way you hold space when i’m breaking a little inside. i never once felt excluded with you. i never felt like i had to try hard to be wanted. being around you feels like being wrapped in a blanket that smells like safety.

i hope you know how precious you are. how deeply loved. i hope today, and every day after, you’re surrounded by people who see you the way i do: someone who is all love and strength and sunshine and soul. you deserve everything good.

i’m so lucky to know you. to have you. to love you. and i can’t wait for every single moment that still lies ahead for us: more dancing, more singing, more chaos, more heart talks, more memories that feel like magic.

happy birthday, my sweet, soft, beautiful girl. the world is better because you’re in it. and so is my heart.

i love you more than you’ll ever know 🤍🩷 AND AS ALWAYS, OUR TAGLINE: even million miles apart, we will never fall apart~~~

forever yours,
aish`,
