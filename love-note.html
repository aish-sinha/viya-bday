            My dearest,
            
            On this special day and every day, I want you to remember how deeply loved you are. 
            This little world was built for you - so you never forget your worth, your light, 
            and the incredible impact you have on everyone around you.
            
            You are allowed to feel everything, and you're never alone in it. 
            On your brightest days and your hardest nights, we're here.
            
            Keep this space close to your heart. Return to it whenever you need reminding 
            of the love that surrounds you always.
            
            Happy birthday, beautiful soul. The world is brighter with you in it.
